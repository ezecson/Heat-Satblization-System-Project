# Heat-Satblization-System-Project
an AVR microcontroller has been used to control the temperature of a cooking pot by stabilize the electricity flow to a heater

## softwares
- Proteus Schemitic Design isis professional:
    has been used to design an inital design and simulate the design
	
- KHAZAMA AVR:
    has been used to upload avr microcontroller with a code
	
- Codevision AVR Evaluation: 
    has been used to write the code of microcontroller in c language 

## features
- read the desired temperature that the user want from keypad.
- display the current temperature and the keypad pressing in lcd
- read the temperatureof the cooking pot by a temperature sensor.
- send a pwm signal to control a transistor which control electricity flow
- electricity flow has been controlled by a transistor
- AC to DC converter has been used because the heater works in DC
